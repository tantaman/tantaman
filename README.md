### Hi there 👋

Here is a taste of what I like to work on and think about as it relates to code.

# 🔭 Open Source
* Re-writing [Strut](https://github.com/tantaman/Strut) to be re-launched with a focus on rapid, non-linear presentation authoring and note taking.
* Working on [language and storage system agnostic](https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite) schema definitions.
* Prototyping centralized logging and real-time detection systems

# ✍️ Currently Writing
* The lost half of domain modeling
* Why programming languages are tied up in incidental details
* Encoding the _why_ into programs
* Expressing policy and regulatory commitments using structural types
* Why string, bool, int, etc. are not types*
* The need for nominal, structural, conceptual, computational and storage types
* Why invariants and assertions are a sign that your language, type system or design is lacking
* The merit behind the statement "OO Design is Bad Design"

# 🤔 Currently Thinking About
* [How](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2021/03/05/bring-your-own-client.html) to [improve](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) software [interoperability](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/)
* [Counterfactuals in ML](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/1541698967/ref=asc_df_1541698967/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459440273404&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6941749223415101727&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007770&hvtargid=pla-917887947980&psc=1)
* [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) and their use in determining the [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance) of digital goods

# 👨🏻‍🔬 Employment
* ⓕ Facebook
  * 2021 - Present: Working on infrastructure to uphold commitments to user privacy
  * 2016-2021: Building & designing products to protect the community from harm. Both [online and offline](https://about.fb.com/news/category/integrity-security/).
  * 2014-2016: Working to enable FB to respect the [laws of the countries in which it operates](https://transparency.facebook.com/)
* 🚢  Lockheed Martin
  * 2012 - 2014: Reaserching, designing and prototyping the next generation of [Sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar) and [Periscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periscope) systems.
  * 2008 - 2012: Building [Sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar) and [Periscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periscope) systems.

In my darker days (circa 2004), I created a website to book exotic dancers.
