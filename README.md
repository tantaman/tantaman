In March 2022, after 15 years in the industry (last 8 at [Meta](meta.com)), I decided to pursue my own dreams of creating tools and frameworks that remove the burden of non-functional requirements that come with local-first development. 

Most of my time @Meta was spent developing frameworks to make code respect [integrity](https://about.fb.com/news/category/integrity-security/) and [privacy](https://about.facebook.com/actions/protecting-privacy-and-security/) by default. The most effective way I found was to build or enrich existing data `schematization` layers. When developers fully describe their data and their opereations or expected contraints, we can infer and enable dozens of value adds. E.g., automated clustering, feature extraction, rendering for human review, deletion, expected write time invariants and so on.

Now, I am taking a similar approach to simplify collaborative, offline & [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) software development with [VLCN](https://vlcn.io) (previously [aphrodite](https://aphrodite.sh/)).
